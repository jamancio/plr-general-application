# PAS LAW III ANALYSIS - TEST 4: r_max for the *Mod 6* Filter (Control Test)
#
# NEW RESEARCH FRONTIER: UNIVERSALIZING THE PLR THEOREM
#
# This is the "control experiment" for Test 1. It tests if the
# r_min = 1 result was a unique property of the "optimal" Mod 210
# filter, or if *any* "perfect" filter (like Mod 6) has it.
#
# HYPOTHESIS:
# The Mod 6 filter is structurally weaker than Mod 210.
# It will have a *higher* Law I Failure Rate and a *larger*
# r_max, proving that r_min = 1 is a unique, non-trivial result.

==================== PAS Law III r_max Test (Test 4 - Mod 6) Report ====================

Total Optimal Anchors Tested (S_n == 0 mod 6): 27,746,449
Total Law I Failures Found: 752,639

-------------------- Final Structural Metrics --------------------
  Law I Failure Rate (Initial Messiness): 2.7126%
  Max Correction Radius (r_max):          16
  Total Unresolved Failures:              0
  Final Resolution Rate:                  100.00%


==================== FINAL ANALYTIC CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED (r_max = 16)]
  The r_max for the Mod 6 filter is significantly larger than 1.
  This definitively proves that the r_min = 1 result
  from Test 1 was a *unique and non-trivial* property
  of the 'Optimal' Mod 210 filter.
