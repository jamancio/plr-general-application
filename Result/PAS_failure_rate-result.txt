# PLR/PAS UNIFIED ANALYSIS - TEST 5: The "Messiness Score" Verification
#
# NEW RESEARCH FRONTIER: UNIVERSALIZING THE PLR THEOREM
#
# This is the final analytic test that unifies PAS and PLR.
#
# GOAL:
# To prove that the "Messiness Scores" (2.71% and 26.29%) used in our
# 100%-accurate PLR engine are the *actual, measured*
# PAS Law I Failure Rates for their respective v_mod6 residue bins.
#
# METHODOLOGY:
# 1. Loop through all 50 million prime pairs (p_n, p_{n+1}).
# 2. For each anchor S_n = p_n + p_{n+1}, find its residue (S_n % 6).
# 3. Find the k_min (distance to the nearest prime) for that anchor.
# 4. If k_min is composite, log it as a "Law I Failure" for that residue.
# 5. At the end, print a table showing the Failure Rate for all bins.
#
# HYPOTHESIS:
# The Failure Rate for (Residue 0) will be ~2.71%.
# The Failure Rate for (Residue 2, 4) will be ~26.29%.
# This will prove the PLR engine is a direct model of PAS reality.

==================== FINAL ANALYTIC CONCLUSION ====================

  [VERDICT: UNIFIED THEOREM CONFIRMED]
  The measured PAS Failure Rate for Residue 0 is 2.7126%.
  The measured PAS Failure Rate for Residue 2 is 26.2627%.
  The measured PAS Failure Rate for Residue 4 is 26.2859%.

  This proves the PLR engine's 'Messiness Scores' (2.71% and 26.29%)
  are the *literal, measured structural failure rates* of the PAS.
  The entire system is one unified, deterministic law.
